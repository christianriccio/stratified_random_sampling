# stratified_random_sampling
My personal python implementation of the stratified random sampling 


While working for my master thesis i needed to sample a very big dataset. The original dataset presented in the target variable 2 classes where one of them was really imbalanced respect to the whole dataset. I wrote a python function to take into account the possiblity to random sample a given percentage of the original dataframe keeping the same proportion between classes the same of the original dataset, so in a stratified way.
